__**Hello!**__
This is a blog I have recently decided to start. I have no idea where it is going to go yet but it will hopefully go in some direction or another.

__**General Topics:**__
* Capture The Flag Events (#GoShellphish)
* Reverse Engineering
* Thoughts
* Video Games
* Music (Maybe?)
* Cool random things (Yeah that goes with thoughts probably)

__**About Me:**__
My name is Nathan (A.K.A Pascal). I am a Computer Systems Engineering major at Arizona State Univeristy with a pursuit in Cyber Security. My interests are Penetration Testing, Reverse Engineering, Binary Analysis, and anything I can toy with if I have time. Though I may not be very good at everything (even my interests), I am constantly learning every day and want to help others learn what I learn. 

__**Certifications:**__
* OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) March 2020
* Certificate of Insanity
