### <u>Hello World!</u>

This is a blog I have recently decided to start. I have no idea where it is going to go yet but it will hopefully go in some direction or another.

### <u>General Topics:</u>

* Capture The Flag Events (#Gopwndevils #GoShellphish)
* Reverse Engineering
* Things related to Penetration Testing
* Video Games
* Music (Maybe?)
* My personal thoughts and random cool things

### <u>About Me:</u>

My name is Nathan (***A.K.A Pascal***). I am a Computer Systems Engineering major at Arizona State University with a pursuit in Cyber Security. My interests are Penetration Testing, Reverse Engineering, Binary Analysis, and anything I can toy with if I have time. Though I may not be very good at everything (even my interests), I am constantly learning every day and want to help others learn what I learn.

### <u>Certifications:</u>

* OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) March 2020
* Certificate of Insanity
