<h3>About Me:</h3>
My name is Nathan (A.K.A Pascal). I am a Computer Systems Engineering major at Arizona State Univeristy with a pursuit in Cyber Security. My interests are Penetration Testing, Reverse Engineering, Binary Analysis, and anything I can toy with if I have time. Though I may not be very good at everything (even my interests), I am constantly learning every day and want to help others learn what I learn. 

<h3>Certifications:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) March 2020</li>
    <li>Certificate of Insanity</li>
</ul>
